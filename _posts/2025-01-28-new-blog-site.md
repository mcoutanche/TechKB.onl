## Welcome to my new blog about all things Azure

I have moth balled my old website [My Blog](https://blog.mashfords.com){:target="_blank"} and launched this new website.

This blog is about to providing you with the latest insights and updates on Azure services, infrastructure-as-code, and more. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned cloud professional or just starting out, I hope my new blog has something for you.

I mostly blog about Azure resources such as Azure Compute, Networking and Storage, specifically Azure NetApp Files.

I hope you find this site and its contents interesting and useful ðŸ˜Š
