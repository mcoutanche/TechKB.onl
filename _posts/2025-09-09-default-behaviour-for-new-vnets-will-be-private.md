# 🚪 Azure’s Default Internet Access Is Retiring — What You Need to Know

If you've been spinning up virtual machines in Azure and relying on default outbound internet access, it's time to rethink your setup. Microsoft has announced that starting **September 30, 2025**, newly created VMs will **no longer have internet access by default**.

That’s right—no more silent outbound connectivity unless you explicitly configure it.

---

## 🔍 Why This Matters

Historically, Azure VMs could reach the internet without any configuration. No NAT gateway, no public IP, no outbound rules—just plug and play.

Convenient? Absolutely.  
Predictable and secure? Not really.

This change forces us to be more intentional with our network design. And honestly, that’s a good thing. If you're architecting for scale, security, or compliance, relying on ephemeral public IPs was always a bit of a gamble.

---

## 🛠️ What You Need to Do

If you're deploying new workloads after the cutoff date, you'll need to plan for outbound access explicitly. Here are your main options:

- **Azure NAT Gateway**  
  Microsoft’s recommended approach. Assign it to your subnet to manage public IPs cleanly and securely.

- **Azure Firewall / NGFW**  
  Ideal for hub-and-spoke architectures. Centralized control, logging, and policy enforcement.

- **Instance-Level Public IPs**  
  Still available, but not ideal for large-scale or secure environments.

- **Load Balancer with Outbound Rules**  
  Useful in specific scenarios, though it adds complexity.

---

## 💡 My Take

This isn’t just a technical update—it’s a nudge toward better architecture.

If you're managing environments with high availability, redundancy, or compliance requirements, this shift aligns with best practices. It's also a great excuse to revisit your network design and ensure it's future-proof.

Existing VMs won’t be impacted (yet), but for consistency and clarity, it’s worth transitioning sooner rather than later. Your future self will thank you.
