ðŸš€ Welcome to My New Azure Technical Blog

If you've stumbled across this postâ€”welcome! Whether youâ€™ve followed my work before or just landed here by accident (thanks, search engine magic), Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here.

Some of you might remember my old blog, where I shared bits and pieces from my journey through the Microsoft tech stack. Itâ€™s been a while since I posted anything thereâ€”life, work, and the occasional blog platform meltdown got in the way. But now, Iâ€™m back with a fresh space, a better setup, and a renewed focus.

This blog is all about Microsoft Azure and the wider ecosystem of technologies that have shaped my careerâ€”from the NT4 days (yes, really) through Hyper-V, RDP, domain services, and now deep into the cloud with Azure. Iâ€™m currently working as an Azure Practice Lead at Cloud Direct, a UK-based Microsoft partner, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of helping businesses modernise, scale, and thrive using Azureâ€™s ever-evolving capabilities.

ðŸ§  What to expect here:

* Weekly posts (thatâ€™s the plan!) diving into technical Azure topics, real-world scenarios, and lessons learned

* Reflections from my journey in cloud architecture, high availability, networking, and storage optimization

* Occasional throwbacks as I migrate content from my old blogâ€”some of it still holds up!

* A bit of storytelling, a bit of troubleshooting, and hopefully a lot of useful insights

Whether you're just starting out with Azure or you're neck-deep in designing enterprise-grade solutions, I hope this blog becomes a space where we can learn, share, and maybe even debate a little.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and if youâ€™ve got questions, ideas, or just want to say hello, drop a comment or connect with me. Letâ€™s make this a conversation, not just a monologue.

Hereâ€™s to the next chapter! â€”Michael
